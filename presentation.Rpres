Introduction
========================================================

Word Prediction App is to use machine learning and data mining techniques to create a product which can predict the next word for the use's input. Basically, it has the following features:

- It allows users to input text with multiple words
- It uses n-grams algorithm to predict the next word 
- Then the result will show up for users

-The app can be found through this link:

Prediction Algorithm
========================================================


Baisally I use n-gram word prediction algorithm based on markov models.
- To predict the next word for a text, the algorithm would reply on the probability of seeing this word together with the previous words.
- In an n-gram, we truncate the history to length n âˆ’ 1 and maximize the conditional probability of seeing that word given all the n-1 words before.
- This is based on Markov assumption: probability of some future event (next word) depends only on a limited history of preceding events
(previous words).
- If no match can be found, then find the previous n-2 words and do that same maximization until we find the best match.

A Novel Approach
========================================================
- I developed a novel approach for word prediction which is based on topic which works well for a long sentence or more input words.
- The primary goal is to find the topic of the input sentence or previous words. 
- To preprocess this, first define the topics in all the corpus which we have where topics includes sports, money, health, politics, entertainments, living and etc.
- Then we can match the input sentence to the topic. 
- Finally find the n-gram output within the topic.

Instruction on How to use the App
========================================================
There are two parts in the app
- On the left-hand side, you can input your words (multiple)
- On the right-hand side, the prediction system will give you a single word which is most likely to appear next to what you have input
